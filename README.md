# 🧪 Drug Classification using Decision Tree Classifier

This project performs classification of drug types based on patient features using a Decision Tree Classifier. It includes two experiments:
1. Accuracy testing across 5 random states.
2. Evaluation of model performance and complexity (tree size) under varying training set sizes.
